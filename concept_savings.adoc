Cloud Tiering shows you the estimated space that you can save on each cluster. After a period of time, it shows you a precise value.

The initial savings opportunity that Cloud Tiering displays is an estimate based on industry standards. We estimate that 70% of the data on the cluster is cold data that you can move to lower-cost object storage.

Cloud Tiering displays an estimate because a 31-day cooling period is needed to determine which data is considered inactive. After this 31-day cooling period, Cloud Tiering replaces the estimate with a precise value.

Here's an example of an estimate:

Here's an example of a precise value for a different cluster that has not been set up for tiering:

And here's an example of a precise value on a cluster that is tiering some of it's volumes, but not all:
