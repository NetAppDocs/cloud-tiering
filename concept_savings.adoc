Cloud Tiering first shows you the _estimated_ space that you can save on each cluster. 31 days after you discover the cluster, it shows you a precise value, if you're running ONTAP 9.4 or later.

The initial savings opportunity that Cloud Tiering displays is an estimate based on industry standards. We estimate that 70% of the data on the cluster is cold data that you can move to lower-cost object storage.

Cloud Tiering displays an estimate because a 31-day cooling period is needed to determine which data is considered inactive. For ONTAP 9.4 and later, Cloud Tiering replaces the estimate with a precise value after this 31-day cooling period.

Here's an example of an estimate showing 8.7 TB of capacity savings:

Here's an example of a precise value for a different cluster that has not been set up for tiering:

And here's an example of a precise value on a cluster that is tiering some of it's volumes, but not all:
