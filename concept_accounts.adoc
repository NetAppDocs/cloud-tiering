Each Cloud Central user is associated with one or more Cloud Central accounts. An account enables multi-tenancy: multiple users can manage data tiering in a single account.

For example, two users might be associated with the same Cloud Central account. Both of those users can see the same clusters that were discovered in that account.

But if those two users are associated with _separate_ Cloud Central accounts, then the users would only see the clusters in the account that they are associated with.

If a user is associated with multiple Cloud Central accounts, you can change to a different account at any time from the User Settings menu in Cloud Tiering.

If you want to associate a user to a specific account, you can use Cloud Central APIs, Cloud Managerâ€™s user interface, or contact us for help using the in-product chat.
