NetApp periodically updates Cloud Tiering to bring you new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

== 2 May 2019

This update includes the following new features and enhancements.

* <<Support for Microsoft Azure>>
* <<Ability to choose an IPspace for connections to object storage>>

=== Support for Microsoft Azure

You can now tier inactive data from your ONTAP clusters to Azure Blob storage.

* link:reference_azure_support.html[Review support for Azure Blob access tiers and Azure regions]

=== Ability to choose an IPspace for connections to object storage

When you set up tiering for an ONTAP cluster, you now need to select the IPspace that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage. Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that Cloud Tiering can set up a connection from ONTAP to your cloud provider's object storage.

To understand the requirements for the IPspace and the associated intercluster LIFs, refer to ONTAP cluster requirements:

== 7 Apr 2019

This update includes the following new features and enhancements.

* <<Support for FAS systems with all-SSD aggregates>>
* <<Support for additional versions of ONTAP>>
* <<Ability to choose the type of cold data that you want to tier>>
* <<Ability to choose an S3 storage class>>

=== Support for FAS systems with all-SSD aggregates

In addition to AFF systems, Cloud Tiering now supports FAS systems that have one or more all-SSD aggregates.

=== Support for additional versions of ONTAP

Cloud Tiering now supports ONTAP 9.2 and 9.3. This is in addition to supporting ONTAP 9.4 and later.

=== Ability to choose the type of cold data that you want to tier

For ONTAP 9.4 and later, you can now choose the type of cold data that you want to tier. You can tier _all cold data_ or just _Snapshot copies_.

If you have an ONTAP 9.2 or 9.3 system, you can tier Snapshot copies only.

The option is available after you click *Set up Tiering*.

=== Ability to choose an S3 storage class

When you set up data tiering on a cluster for the first time, you can now choose to tier cold data to the S3 _Standard_ storage class or to the _Standard-Infrequent Access_ storage class. https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/[Learn about these S3 storage classes^].
