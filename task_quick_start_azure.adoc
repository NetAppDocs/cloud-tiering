[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need the following:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* An AFF or FAS system with all-SSD aggregates running ONTAP 9.4 or later, and an HTTPS connection to Azure Blob storage.
* An Azure account that has the https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_Setup_As_Service_Azure.json[required permissions^] to deploy the Service Connector in a VNet.
+
The Service Connector needs an outbound HTTPS connection to the ONTAP cluster in your data center, to Azure Blob storage, and to the Cloud Tiering service.
