[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need the following:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* An AFF or FAS system with all-SSD aggregates running ONTAP 9.2 or later, and a network connection to AWS S3.
* An AWS account that has an access key and link:task_preparing.html#preparing-aws-s3-for-data-tiering[the required permissions] so the ONTAP cluster can tier inactive data in and out of AWS S3.
* An AWS account that has an access key and https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_Setup_As_Service.json[the required permissions^] to deploy the Service Connector in a VPC.
+
The VPC must provide an outbound connection to the ONTAP cluster in your data center, to S3 storage, and to the Cloud Tiering service.
+
This account can be the same account that you use for the S3 bucket, or a different account.
