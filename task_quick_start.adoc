You need the following:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* An AFF or FAS system with all-SSD aggregates running ONTAP 9.2 or later, and a network connection to AWS S3.
* An AWS account that has an access key and link:task_preparing.html#preparing-aws-s3-for-data-tiering[the required permissions] so the ONTAP cluster can tier inactive data in and out of AWS S3.
* An AWS account that has an access key and https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_Setup_As_Service.json[the required permissions^] to deploy the Service Connector in a VPC.
+
The VPC must provide an outbound connection to the ONTAP cluster in your data center, to S3 storage, and to the Cloud Tiering service.

This account can be the same account that you use for the S3 bucket, or a different account.
