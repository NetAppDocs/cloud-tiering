Getting started with Cloud Tiering in AWS includes a few steps.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need the following:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* An AFF or FAS system with all-SSD aggregates running ONTAP 9.2 or later, and an HTTPS connection to AWS S3.
* An AWS account that has an access key and link:task_preparing.html#preparing-aws-s3-for-data-tiering[the required permissions] so the ONTAP cluster can tier inactive data in and out of AWS S3.
* A location for the Service Connector: either link:task_preparing.html#preparing-to-deploy-the-service-connector-in-an-aws-vpc[an AWS VPC] or link:task_installing_service_connector.html[an on-premises Linux host].
+
With either option, the Service Connector needs an outbound HTTPS connection to the ONTAP cluster, to S3 storage, and to the Cloud Tiering service.
