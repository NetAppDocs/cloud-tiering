After you prepare your Google Cloud environment, just log in to Cloud Tiering and start tiering inactive data from your first cluster.

== Discovering your first cluster

Your first step is to deploy a NetApp Service Connector, which discovers information about the active and inactive data on your ONTAP cluster.

.What you'll need
* The cluster management IP address of your cluster.
* The user name and password of an ONTAP account that has administrator-level privileges.
+
The Service Connector uses this account to send API operations to the ONTAP cluster.
* A Google account that has the required permissions to deploy the Service Connector virtual machine.
* The project, region, VPC, and subnet in which the Service Connector will reside.
* A service account that includes the permissions defined in the link:media/Policy_for_Service_Connector.yaml[Service Connector policy for GCP^]. 

If you haven't met these requirements, see link:task_preparing_google.html[Preparing to tier data to Google Cloud Storage].

.Steps

. Go to http://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^].

. Log in and select the Cloud Tiering service.

. Click *Let's Start, Discover Your First Cluster*.

. Enter information about your ONTAP cluster:
+
* The cluster management IP address
* The user name and password of an account that has administrator-level privileges

. Click *Add Service Connector* and follow the prompts:

.. Select *Google Cloud Platform* as the target location for the Service Connector.

.. When prompted, sign in and accept the permissions request from Google.
+
The form is owned and hosted by Google. Your credentials are not provided to NetApp.

.. *Basic Settings*: Enter a name for the virtual machine and then select a project and service account.

.. *Location*: Specify networking for the virtual machine--a region, zone, VPC, and subnet, and then choose whether you want to assign a public IP address and specify an HTTP proxy for outbound connectivity.
+
Remember, the Service Connector must have a constant connection to the ONTAP cluster and a constant internet connection to the Cloud Tiering service.

.. *Firewall Policy*: Select *Create a new firewall policy* so Cloud Tiering can create the security group, or select an existing firewall policy.
+
The firewall policy that Cloud Tiering creates allows inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH connectivity. It has open outbound connectivity.

.. Click *Go*.

. Back on the Discover ONTAP Cluster page, select the Service Connector that you just created and click *Continue*.

== Tiering inactive data to a Google Cloud Storage bucket

You're now ready to start tiering inactive data to low-cost object storage.

.What you'll need
* Storage access keys for a service account that has the Storage Admin role.
* The region where the Google Cloud Storage bucket will reside.

.Steps

. Click *Set up Tiering* and follow the prompts.

. *Source Volumes*: Select the volumes that you want to tier and choose a tiering policy for each volume.

+

. *Cluster Connectivity*: Select the IPspace that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage.
+
Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that Cloud Tiering can set up a connection from ONTAP to your cloud provider's object storage.
+
If you haven't reviewed requirements for the IPspace and the associated intercluster LIFs, see link:task_preparing_google.html#preparing-your-ontap-clusters[ONTAP cluster requirements].

. *Object Storage Provider*: Click *Continue* to choose Google Cloud as your object storage provider.

. *Object Storage*: Enter the information needed for the GCP bucket:
* A storage access key and secret key for a service account
* The region for the bucket
* The storage class (only Standard is supported at this time)
+
TIP: You don't need to create the Google Cloud Storage bucket. Cloud Tiering does that for you.

. *Review*: Review your selections and click *Go*.

.What's next?
Add additional clusters or review information about the active and inactive data on the cluster. For details, see link:task_managing_tiering.html[Managing data tiering from your clusters].
