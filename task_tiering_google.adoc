After you prepare your Google Cloud environment, just log in to Cloud Tiering and start tiering inactive data from your first cluster.

.What you'll need
* To discover the cluster, you'll need the following:
** The cluster management IP address.
** The user name and password of an ONTAP account that has administrator-level privileges.
+
The Service Connector uses this account to send API operations to the ONTAP cluster.
* To deploy the Service Connector in GCP, you'll need the following:
** A Google account that has the required permissions to deploy the Service Connector virtual machine.
** The project, region, VPC, and subnet in which the Service Connector will reside.
** A service account that includes the permissions defined in the link:media/Policy_for_Service_Connector.yaml[Service Connector policy for GCP^].
* To set up tiering to Google Cloud Storage, you'll need storage access keys for a service account that has the Storage Admin role.

If you haven't met these requirements, see link:task_preparing_google.html[Preparing to tier data to Google Cloud Storage].

.Steps

. Log in to http://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^].

. Select the Cloud Tiering service.

. Click *Let's Start, Discover Your First Cluster*.

. Complete the steps on the *Discover Cluster* page:

.. Enter the cluster management IP address and the user name and password of an account that has administrator-level privileges.
+

.. Click *Discover Cluster*.
+
If you already have an existing Service Connector, then Cloud Tiering automatically attempts to use that Service Connector. Cloud Tiering moves on to the next step, if any existing Service Connector has connectivity to the cluster.

.. If Cloud Tiering prompts you to create a Service Connector, click *Create your first Service Connector*.
+
If you have an existing Service Connector and Cloud Tiering can't use it, then you'll need to do one of two things:
+
* Click *Add Service Connector* to create a new Service Connector.
* Check the status and connectivity of any existing Service Connectors and then try to discover the cluster again.

.. If you clicked the button to create a Service Connector, follow the prompts to deploy it in GCP:

* *Select Provider*: Select *Google Cloud Platform* as the target location for the Service Connector.
+
When prompted, sign in and accept the permissions request from Google. The form is owned and hosted by Google. Your credentials are not provided to NetApp.

* *Basic Settings*: Enter a name for the virtual machine, select a project, and then select a service account that includes the permissions defined in the link:media/Policy_for_Service_Connector.yaml[Service Connector policy for GCP^].

* *Location*: Specify networking for the virtual machine--a region, zone, VPC, and subnet, and then choose whether you want to assign a public IP address and specify an HTTP proxy for outbound connectivity.
+
Remember, the Service Connector must have a constant connection to the ONTAP cluster and a constant internet connection to the Cloud Tiering service.

* *Firewall Policy*: Select *Create a new firewall policy* so Cloud Tiering can create the security group, or select an existing firewall policy. Then click *Go*.
+
The firewall policy that Cloud Tiering creates allows inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH connectivity. It has open outbound connectivity.
+
Leave the page open until the deployment is complete.

.. Back on the Discover Cluster page, select the Service Connector that you just created.

. Complete the steps on the *Tiering Setup* page:

.. *Bucket*: Add a new Google Cloud Storage bucket or select an existing bucket and click *Continue*.

.. *Storage Class*: Select the storage class that you want to use for the tiered data and click *Continue*.

.. *Credentials*: Enter the storage access key and secret key for a service account that has the Storage Admin role.

.. *Cluster Network*: Select the IPspace that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage and click *Continue*.
+
Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that Cloud Tiering can set up a connection from ONTAP to your cloud provider's object storage.
+
If you haven't reviewed requirements for the IPspace and the associated intercluster LIFs, see link:task_preparing.html#preparing-your-ontap-clusters[ONTAP cluster requirements].

. Click *Continue* to select the volumes that you want to tier.

. For each volume, click the image:screenshot_edit_icon.gif[A screenshot of the edit icon that appears at the end of each row in the table for tiering volumes] icon, select a tiering policy, optionally adjust the cooling days, and click *Apply*.
+
link:concept_architecture.html#volume-tiering-policies[Learn about volume tiering policies and cooling days].
+
image:screenshot_volumes_select.gif["A screenshot that shows volumes selected in the Tier Volumes page."]

. When you're done, click *Close*.

.Result

You've successfully set up data tiering from volumes on the cluster to Google Cloud object storage.
