After you prepare your Azure environment, just log in to Cloud Tiering and start tiering inactive data from your first cluster.

== Discovering your first cluster

Your first step is to deploy a NetApp Service Connector, which discovers information about the active and inactive data on your ONTAP cluster.

.What you'll need
* The cluster management IP address of your cluster.
* The user name and password of an ONTAP account that has administrator-level privileges.
+
The Service Connector uses this account to send API operations to the ONTAP cluster.
* An Azure account that has the required permissions to deploy the Service Connector virtual machine.
* The Azure subscription, region, VNet, and subnet in which the Service Connector will reside.

If you haven't met these requirements, see link:task_preparing_azure.html[Preparing to tier data to Azure].

.Steps

. Go to http://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^].

. Log in and select the Cloud Tiering service.

. Click *Let's Start, Discover Your First Cluster*.

. Enter information about your ONTAP cluster:
+
* The cluster management IP address
* The user name and password of an account that has administrator-level privileges

. Click *Add Service Connector* and follow the prompts:

.. Select *Microsoft Azure* as the target location for the Service Connector.

.. When prompted, accept the permissions request from Microsoft.
+
The form is owned and hosted by Microsoft. Your credentials are not provided to NetApp.

.. *Virtual Machine Authentication*: Enter a name for the virtual machine and choose an authentication method.

.. *Basic Settings*: Select an Azure subscription, choose a region, and specify a new or existing resource group for the virtual machine.

.. *Network*: Select a VNet and subnet, choose whether to assign a public IP address, and specify an HTTP proxy, if one is required for outbound connectivity.
+
Remember, the Service Connector must have a constant connection to the ONTAP cluster and a constant internet connection to the Cloud Tiering service.

.. *Security Group*: Select *Create a new security group* so Cloud Tiering can create the security group, or select an existing security group.
+
The security group that Cloud Tiering creates has no inbound connectivity and open outbound connectivity.

. Back on the Discover ONTAP Cluster page, select the Service Connector that you just created and click *Continue*.

== Tiering inactive data to Azure Blob storage

You're now ready to start tiering inactive data to low-cost object storage.

.Steps

. Click *Set up Tiering* and follow the prompts.

. *Source Volumes*: Optionally change the tiering policy and then select the volumes to tier.

.. Keep the default _Auto_ tiering policy or change to the _Snapshot only_ tiering policy.
+

.. Select the volumes that you would like to tier and click *Continue*.
+

. *Cluster Connectivity*: Select the IPspace that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage.
+
Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that Cloud Tiering can set up a connection from ONTAP to your cloud provider's object storage.
+
If you haven't reviewed requirements for the IPspace and the associated intercluster LIFs, see link:task_preparing_azure.html#preparing-your-ontap-clusters[ONTAP cluster requirements].

. *Object Storage Provider*: Click *Continue* to choose Azure as your object storage provider.

. *Bucket*: Enter the information needed for your object storage provider and click *Continue*.
* The region for the Blob container
* The Blob access tier (only Hot is supported at this time)
+
TIP: You don't need to create the Blob container. Cloud Tiering does that for you.

. *Review*: Review your selections and click *Tier Cluster*.

.What's next?
Add additional clusters or review information about the active and inactive data on the cluster. For details, see link:task_managing_tiering.html[Managing data tiering from your clusters].
