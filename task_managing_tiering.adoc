Now that you've discovered and tiered data from your first ONTAP cluster, you can tier data from additional volumes, discover additional clusters, and more.

== Discovering additional clusters

Add additional ONTAP clusters at any time to start tiering inactive data from those clusters.

.Steps

. From the Cluster Dashboard, click the following icon:
+

. Enter the cluster management IP address and the user name and password of an account that has administrator-level privileges.

. Select an existing Service Connector that has a connection to the cluster, or create a new one and click *Continue*.

.What's next?

Click *Set up Tiering* to start tiering inactive data from the cluster.

== Tiering data from additional volumes

Set up data tiering for additional volumes at any time--for example, after creating a new volume.

.Steps

. From the Cluster Dashboard, click *Set up Tiering*.

. If you have a system running ONTAP 9.4 or later, keep the default _Auto_ tiering policy or change to the _Snapshot only_ tiering policy.

. Select the volumes that you would like to tier and click *Continue*.
+

. Click *Tier Cluster*.
+
TIP: You don't need to configure the object storage because it was already configured when you initially set up tiering for the cluster. ONTAP will tier inactive data from these volumes to the same object store.

== Reviewing data tiering info for a cluster

You might want to see how much data is in the cloud tier and how much data is on disks. Or, you might want to see the amount of hot and cold data on the cluster's disks. Cloud Tiering provides this information for each cluster.

.Steps

. From the Cluster Dashboard, click *More info* for a cluster.
+

. Review details about the cluster.

Here's an example:

== Fixing tiering health

Failures can happen. When they do, Cloud Tiering displays a "Failed" health status on the Cluster Dashboard. The health reflects the status of the ONTAP system and the Service Connector.

.Steps

. Identify any clusters that have a tiering health of "Failed."

. Hover over the image:screenshot_info_icon.gif[A screenshot of the i icon that shows the failure reason] icon to see the failure reason.

. Correct the issue:

.. Verify that the ONTAP cluster is operational and that it has an inbound and outbound connection to your object storage provider.

.. Verify that the Service Connector is running and that it has outbound connections to the Cloud Tiering service, to the object store, and to the ONTAP clusters that it discovers.
+
TIP: The name of the Service Connector instance/virtual machine is prefixed with "Service-connector."
