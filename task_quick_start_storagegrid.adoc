[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need the following:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* An AFF or FAS system with all-SSD aggregates running ONTAP 9.4 or later, and a connection over port 80 to StorageGRID.
* StorageGRID 10.3 or later with a CA certificate and AWS access keys that have S3 permissions.
* A Service Connector installed on an on-premises Linux host.

The Service Connector needs an outbound HTTPS connection to the ONTAP cluster, to StorageGRID, and to the Cloud Tiering service.
