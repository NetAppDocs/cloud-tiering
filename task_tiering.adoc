After you prepare your AWS environment, just log in to Cloud Tiering and start tiering inactive data from your first cluster.

== Discovering your first cluster

Your first step is to select or deploy a NetApp Service Connector, which discovers information about the active and inactive data on your ONTAP cluster.

.What you'll need
* The cluster management IP address of your cluster.
* The user name and password of an ONTAP account that has administrator-level privileges.
+
The Service Connector uses this account to send API operations to the ONTAP cluster.
* To deploy the Service Connector in AWS, you'll need the following:
** The AWS region, VPC, and subnet in which the Service Connector will reside.
** An AWS account that has the required permissions and an access key.

If you haven't met these requirements, see link:task_preparing.html[Preparing your environment].

.Steps

. Go to http://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^].

. Log in and select the Cloud Tiering service.

. Click *Let's Start, Discover Your First Cluster*.

. Enter the cluster management IP address and the user name and password of an account that has administrator-level privileges.

. For the Service Connector, choose one of the following options:
* Select the link:task_installing_service_connector.html[on-premises Service Connector that you previously deployed] and click *Continue*.
* Click *Add Service Connector* and follow the prompts to deploy a Service Connector in AWS:
+
.. *Select Provider*: Click *Continue* to choose AWS as the target location for the Service Connector.
.. *AWS Credentials*: Enter the AWS access key ID and secret key for an account that has https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_Setup_As_Service.json[the required permissions^] to deploy the Service Connector.

.. *Location*: Select the AWS region, VPC, and subnet for the Service Connector EC2 instance.
+
Remember, the Service Connector must have a constant connection to the ONTAP cluster and a constant internet connection to the Cloud Tiering service.

.. *Network*: Select a key pair to use for the EC2 instance, choose whether to assign a public IP, and specify an HTTP proxy, if one is required for outbound connectivity.

.. *Security Group*: Select *Create a new security group* so Cloud Tiering can create the security group, or select your own.
+
The security group that Cloud Tiering creates has no inbound connectivity and open outbound connectivity.

.. Back on the Discover ONTAP Cluster page, select the Service Connector that you just created and click *Continue*.

== Tiering inactive data to AWS S3

You're now ready to start tiering inactive data to low-cost object storage.

.What you'll need
* An AWS access key for the account in which you want the S3 bucket to reside
* The right permissions for that account so the ONTAP cluster can tier data in and out of S3

If you haven't met these requirements, see link:task_preparing.html[Preparing your environment].

.Steps

. Click *Set up Tiering* and follow the prompts.

. *Source Volumes*: Optionally change the tiering policy and then select the volumes to tier.

.. If you have a system running ONTAP 9.4 or later, keep the default _Auto_ tiering policy or change to the _Snapshot only_ tiering policy.
+

.. Select the volumes that you would like to tier and click *Continue*.
+

. *Cluster Connectivity*: Select the IPspace that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage.
+
Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that Cloud Tiering can set up a connection from ONTAP to your cloud provider's object storage.
+
If you haven't reviewed requirements for the IPspace and the associated intercluster LIFs, see link:task_preparing.html#preparing-your-ontap-clusters[ONTAP cluster requirements].

. *Object Storage Provider*: Click *Continue* to choose AWS as your object storage provider.

. *Bucket*: Enter the information needed for your object storage provider.
* The access key ID and secret key for the account
* The region for the S3 bucket
* The S3 storage class that you want to use
+
TIP: You don't need to create the S3 bucket. Cloud Tiering does that for you.

. *Review*: Review your selections and click *Tier Cluster*.

You can also add additional clusters or review information about the active and inactive data on the cluster. For details, see link:task_managing_tiering.html[Managing data tiering from your clusters].
