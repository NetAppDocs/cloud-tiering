After you prepare your environment, just log in to Cloud Tiering and start tiering inactive data from your first cluster.

== Discovering your first cluster

Your first step is to deploy a NetApp Service Connector, which discovers information about the active and inactive data on your ONTAP cluster.

.What you'll need
* The cluster management IP address of your cluster.
* The user name and password of an account that has administrator-level privileges.
+
The Service Connector uses this account to send API operations to the ONTAP cluster.
* The region, VPC, and subnet in which the Service Connector will reside.
* An AWS account that has the required permissions and an access key.

If you haven't met these requirements, see link:task_preparing.html[Preparing your environment].

.Steps

. Go to http://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^].

. Log in and select the Cloud Tiering service.

. Click *Let's Start, Discover Your First Cluster*.

. Enter the cluster management IP address and the user name and password of an account that has administrator-level privileges.

. Click *Add Service Connector* and follow the prompts:
.. *Select Provider*: Click *Continue* to choose AWS as the target location for the Service Connector.
.. *AWS Credentials*: Enter the AWS access key ID and secret key for an account that has https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_Setup_As_Service.json[the required permissions^] to deploy the Service Connector.

.. *Location*: Select the AWS region, VPC, and subnet for the Service Connector EC2 instance.
+
Remember, the Service Connector must have a constant connection to the ONTAP cluster and a constant internet connection to the Cloud Tiering service.

.. *Network*: Select a key pair to use for the EC2 instance, choose whether to assign a public IP, and specify an HTTP proxy, if one is required for outbound connectivity.

.. *Security Group*: Select *Create a new security group* so Cloud Tiering can create the security group, or select your own.
+
The security group that Cloud Tiering creates has no inbound connectivity and open outbound connectivity.

. Back on the Discover ONTAP Cluster page, select the Service Connector that you just created and click *Continue*.

== Tiering inactive data to object storage

You're now ready to start tiering inactive data to low-cost object storage.

.What you'll need
* An AWS access key for the account in which you want the S3 bucket to reside
* The right permissions for that account so the ONTAP cluster can tier data in and out of S3

If you haven't met these requirements, see link:task_preparing.html[Preparing your environment].

.Steps

. Click *Set up Tiering*.

. Select the volumes that you would like to tier and click *Continue*.
+

. Click *Continue* to choose AWS as your object storage provider.

. Enter the information needed for your object storage provider:
* The access key ID and secret key for the account
* The region for the S3 bucket
* The S3 storage class that you want to use
+
TIP: You don't need to create the S3 bucket. Cloud Tiering does that for you.

. Review your selections and click *Tier Cluster*.

.What's next?
Add additional clusters or review information about the active and inactive data on the cluster. For details, see link:task_managing_tiering.html[Managing data tiering from your clusters].
