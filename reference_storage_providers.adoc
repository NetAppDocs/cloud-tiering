At this time, Cloud Tiering can tier your inactive data to AWS S3. Support is coming soon for Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and StorageGRID.

== AWS S3

Cloud Tiering supports two S3 storage classes and most regions.

=== Supported S3 storage classes

When you set up data tiering on a cluster, you can choose the _S3 Standard_ storage class or the _Standard-Infrequent Access_ storage class. If you choose Standard-Infrequent, inactive data starts in the Standard storage class and transitions to Standard-Infrequent Access, if the data is not accessed after 30 days.
