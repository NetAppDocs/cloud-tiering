Cloud Tiering supports two S3 storage classes and most regions.

== Supported S3 storage classes

When you set up data tiering on a cluster, you can choose the _S3 Standard_ storage class or the _Standard-Infrequent Access_ storage class. If you choose Standard-Infrequent, inactive data starts in the Standard storage class and transitions to Standard-Infrequent Access, if the data is not accessed after 30 days.
