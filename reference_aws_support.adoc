Cloud Tiering supports several S3 storage classes and most regions.

== Supported S3 storage classes

Cloud Tiering can apply a lifecycle rule so the data transitions from the _Standard_ storage class to another storage class after 30 days. You can choose from the following storage classes:

* Standard-Infrequent Access
* One Zone-IA
* Intelligent

If you choose Standard, then the data remains in that storage class.
