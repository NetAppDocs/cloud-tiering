[.lead]
A free 10 TB license is automatically applied during the Controlled Availability release. Capacity-based licensing will be available after the Controlled Availability.

For the Controlled Availability release, Cloud Tiering applies a free 10 TB FabricPool license to each ONTAP cluster. This license enables you to tier up to 10 TB of inactive data from the cluster to low-cost object storage.

After the Controlled Availability release, Cloud Tiering will offer capacity-based licensing in a pay-as-you-go model and in a bring your own license (BYOL) model. The licensing is flexible--you can mix and match between pay-as-you-go and BYOL.
