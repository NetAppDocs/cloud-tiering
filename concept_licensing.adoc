The Controlled Availability release of Cloud Tiering includes a 30-day free trial. Cloud Tiering will offer capacity-based licensing after the Controlled Availability release.

Cloud Tiering will offer capacity-based licensing in a pay-as-you-go model and in a bring your own license (BYOL) model. The licensing is flexible--you can mix and match between pay-as-you-go and BYOL. More details will be available soon.
