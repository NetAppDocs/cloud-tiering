[.lead]
Cloud Tiering offers capacity-based licensing in a pay-as-you-go model.

A 30-day free trial starts when you set up tiering to your first cluster. You should subscribe to the Cloud Tiering service to ensure that there's no disruption of service after your free trial ends. When the trial ends, you'll be charged hourly according to the amount of data that you tier.

A bring your own license (BYOL) model will be available in the coming months.
